<!--
Brief:
- Please program your own version of Hacker News (https://news.ycombinator.com/) in the following way:
- Obtain the content using the Hacker News API (https://github.com/HackerNews/API), such that the stories displayed match those shown on the real page:
- Items, comments and related should be taken into account
- Submission actions need not to be taken into account
- To access the API and build the content, use the Silex framework (https://silex.symfony.com/)
- To style the content, use Bootstrap (http://getbootstrap.com/) and adhere to HTML5 standards. The exact design is not important, but it should be functional and responsive, and convey at least as much information as the real page.
- Use Github so that we can see your development process
